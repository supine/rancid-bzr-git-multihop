#
# PAR - parallel processing of command
#
# par -q -n # -l logfile -c command -x -d
#   -q = quiet mode (don't log anything to the logfiles)
#   -n # = number of processes to run at once (default = 3)
#   -l logfile = logfile to store par logging into (.0-.n)
#   -c command = command to run (can also be in the list
#                of routers begining with a :
#   -x = view par logs as they run through xterms
#   -i = run commands through interactive xterms
#   -d = print debugging to stderr
#   -p # = pause # seconds between forks, default 0.
#   -f = no file or STDIN, just run a quantity of $command.
#                This precludes passing different args to each process.
#   -e = exec args split by spaces rather than use sh -c
#
# par takes a list of items to run a command on.  If the list entry begins
# with a ":" the remainder of the line is the command to run ("{}" will be
# replaced with each subsequent item in the list.  If the list entry begins
# with a "#", the entry is ignored.  If a command is defined (either with
# the -c or with a : line) any entry thereafter will be applied to the
# command by replacing the {} brackets.  In no cammand is defined, then each
# line is assumed to be a command to be run.
